CaT-z: Classification and Tracking in depth (z)

Software for the acquisition, annotation, and automatic behavioral profile characterization of laboratory rodents' RGB-D videos

CaT-z is composed of three modules. To run each one, download the .zip file using the "Release" tab (https://github.com/CaTz-Tools/CaT-z-PeerReview/releases) and run the following batch files:

RGB-D data Acquisition GUI (with the Microsoft Kinect v2 camera or the Intel Real Sense camera):
> CaT_z_dataAcquisitionGUI.bat 

RGB-D data Visualization and Annotation:
> CaT_z_VisualizationAnnotationGUI.bat

3D Tracking and Classification GUI:
> CaT_z_TrackingClassificationGUI.bat


To run the Data Acquisition module with the Microsoft Kinect v2 camera, you need first to install Microsoft Kinect SDK 2.0. Please use the following link to download the installation file:
